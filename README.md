# CISC374-BirdTutorial
This is a tutorial project used to overview Unity3D in CISC374.
I have used the hehe sound from this website: https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/search/hehe%20laugh/

I have also used deepSeek to check my work, and used it to guide me in the correct direction.
I used it mainly to find new features and functionality which was not mentioned in the video.
